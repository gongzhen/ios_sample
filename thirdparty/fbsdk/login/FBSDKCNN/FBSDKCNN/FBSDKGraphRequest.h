 By default, non-batched FBSDKGraphRequest instances will automatically try to recover
 from errors by constructing a `FBSDKGraphErrorRecoveryProcessor` instance that
 re-issues the request on successful recoveries. The re-issued request will call the same
 handler as the receiver but may occur with a different `FBSDKGraphRequestConnection` instance.
 
 This will override [FBSDKSettings setGraphErrorRecoveryDisabled:].
